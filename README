DESCRIPTION
Re-executes the last / Nth ex command previously entered in command mode. An
optional pattern is used to locate the most recent matching command. This is
similar to the command-line window (q:), or navigating the command history via
<Up> and <Down>, but provides an even faster way to re-execute a command if
you remember some characters or a pattern that identifies the command line.
The redocommand itself will not be included in the command history. Global
literal replacement can be done via 'old=new' arguments. 

This is modeled after the 'fc -s' command from the Posix shell (which is often
aliased to 'r'). 

USAGE
:[N]Redocommand (or abbreviated :R)
			Execute the last / Nth ex command. 

:[N]Redocommand {pattern}
			Execute the last / Nth ex command that matches
			{pattern}.
			Settings such as 'magic' and 'ignorecase' apply. 

			With N=0, only the very last command from the history
			is executed if it matches {pattern}; the entire
			history isn't searched. 

			Note: If the {pattern} starts with : (and there is no
			history command matching the literal ":cmd"), the
			history is searched for "cmd", anchored at the
			beginning. This is convenient because ":R :echo" is
			more intuitive to type than ":R ^echo". 

:[N]Redocommand {old}={new} [{old2}={new2} ...] [{pattern}]
			Execute the last / Nth ex command (that matches
			{pattern}), replacing all literal occurrences of {old}
			with {new}. 
								 *:RedoRepeat*
:[N]RedoRepeat [{old}={new} ...] (or abbreviated :RR)
			Execute the last / Nth ex command that was repeated
			via :Redocommand. Any replacements done the last time
			are still in effect; new replacements of {old} to
			{new} can be added. 

EXAMPLE
Given the following history:
    :history
    1 e foo.txt 
    2 %s/foo/\0bar/g 
    3 w bar.txt 
:Redocommand		will execute :w bar.txt
:Redocommand %		will execute :%s/foo\0/bar/g
:Redocommand foo	will execute :%s/foo\0/bar/g
:2Redocommand foo	will execute :e foo.txt
:Redocommand b=B .txt=	will execute ':w bar.txt' as :w Bar

:echo "another command"
:RedoRepeat		will again execute :w Bar
:2RedoRepeat		will execute :%s/foo\0/bar/g
:RedoRepeat B=F		will execute :w Far
:Redocommand		will execute :echo "another command"
:RedoRepeat		will execute :w Far
